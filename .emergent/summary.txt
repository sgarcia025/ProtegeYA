The AI engineer successfully initiated the ProtegeYa project, moving from initial setup to a functional MVP by iteratively addressing user requirements. The process began by confirming the tech stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and prioritizing critical integrations (WhatsApp/UltraMSG, OpenAI via Emergent LLM Key). Key challenges involved debugging  handling in MongoDB, fixing frontend routing issues (from  to ), and ensuring data consistency across backend and frontend, especially with broker and lead profiles. The engineer progressively built out core modules like the quoting engine, role-based authentication, user/broker/lead management, and system configuration. User feedback was crucial in refining functionalities and ensuring data visibility. The current state reflects a robust foundation, with the manual lead creation and assignment feature being the immediate focus, demonstrating a clear progression from core features to more granular administrative controls.

The goal is to build **ProtegeYa** (Guatemala), a WhatsApp-centric platform for vehicle insurance. Drivers compare indicative prices, opt-in for broker contact, and are auto-assigned. Brokers manage leads via a dashboard, updating statuses like . Admin handles analytics, reports, broker payments, configurable insurance products, and segmented WhatsApp broadcasts. The platform acts as a comparison and lead-generation service, not an insurer. UI is in Spanish (es-GT), currency GTQ, timezone America/Guatemala.

**MVP Scope (initial focus):**
*   **Lead & Quoting Engine:** WhatsApp flow collects vehicle/contact data via an AI bot (OpenAI GPT for chat, Whisper for voice notes), returns 3-4 indicative quotes with a legal disclaimer, offers PDF, and asks for broker contact. Leads are , , .
*   **Broker CRM (simple):** Dashboard to view assigned leads, update status (, , , , , ). SLA timers (2h first contact, 4h reassignment).
*   **Admin Mini Panel:** Create 2-3 configurable insurance products (insurers, product types, tariff sections, fixed benefits).
*   **WhatsApp Integration:** UltraMSG (mocked initially) for inbound/outbound, voice notes transcription.
*   **Auth:** Login/roles (admin/broker).
*   **User Management:** Admin creates/manages users with 'admin' (superuser) and 'broker' roles.
*   **Broker Management:** Admin manages brokers (edit, activate/deactivate), tracks payments. Broker profile includes  (brokerage name).
*   **Subscription Plans:** Admin can edit/create plans (Q500.00 base plan, with benefits, amount, periodicity).
*   **Manual Lead Creation/Assignment:** Admin can manually create leads and assign them to brokers, selecting the chosen quote/insurer.
*   **Insurance Rate Configuration:** Admin module to configure rates by Insurer, type (auto, medical), coverage (full, RC), own damage rate, RC amount, other damage rate, other benefits.
*   **Admin Broker Lead View:** Admin dashboard to visualize leads per broker by CRM status.

-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI components.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation, Motor for async MongoDB.
-   **Database:** MongoDB.
-   **Authentication:** JWT.
-   **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT (chat) and Whisper (voice notes) via Emergent LLM Key.
-   **WhatsApp Integration:** UltraMSG (mocked initially).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



**Detailed Directory Structure and Key Files:**

*   
    *   : The main FastAPI application. This file handles API routes for authentication, user management, broker management, lead management, insurance product configuration (insurers, products, product versions, tariff sections, fixed benefits), and the quoting engine. It includes Pydantic models for request/response validation and interacts with MongoDB using Motor. Key changes include implementing JWT authentication, user/broker CRUD,  fixes for  handling, and adding endpoints for subscription plans and system configuration.
    *   : Stores environment variables like , , and . Crucial for securing and configuring the backend.
    *   : Lists Python dependencies like To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , , , . Updated to include  for password hashing.

*   
    *   : Manages Node.js dependencies for the React app, including  (Shadcn UI base components), , , , , , .
    *   : Contains , which the frontend uses to communicate with the backend.
    *   : The main React component, acting as the primary router. It manages authentication state, user roles, and conditionally renders navigation and components based on the logged-in user. Crucial changes involved replacing  with  for proper React routing and integrating new components like , , , , and .
    *   : Global styles for the application, configured with TailwindCSS. Updated to reflect the brand colors (dark navy blue, bright green) extracted from the provided logo, adhering to design guidelines.
    *   : Contains Shadcn UI components used throughout the application for a consistent and modern UI.
    *   : A new component for admin users to manage (create, edit, view) system users, including assigning roles (admin, broker).
    *   : Manages broker profiles, including name, brokerage, and subscription status. It fetches and displays broker data.
    *   : Displays a table of leads, allowing viewing of lead details and statuses. Itâ€™s being enhanced for manual lead creation and assignment.
    *   : Provides an interface for admins to configure WhatsApp (UltraMSG) settings and AI (OpenAI) keys.
    *   : Displays and allows management of subscription plans offered by ProtegeYa for brokers.

The architecture emphasizes modularity with distinct frontend components and backend endpoints, promoting clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the functionality to **create and assign leads manually**. The user explicitly requested this as an initial step before automatic assignment.

The work involves:
1.  **Adding a UI element** (button) to trigger the manual lead creation flow within the Leads Management component.
2.  **Developing a modal or form** for users (likely admin) to input lead details (name, phone, vehicle, chosen quote/insurer/price).
3.  **Implementing the logic** to persist these manually created leads in the database.
4.  **Enabling manual assignment** of these leads to specific brokers.

The latest actions (Chat Messages 225-230) indicate the engineer has started modifying frontend files like  to add the necessary UI components for this feature. The backend already has basic lead creation capabilities, which will be extended to support manual assignment.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the manual lead creation and assignment functionality, focusing on the UI and backend logic.
