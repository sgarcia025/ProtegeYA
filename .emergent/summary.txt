<analysis>
The AI engineer's work on ProtegeYa focused heavily on integrating and stabilizing the UltraMSG WhatsApp functionality, extending core CRM features, and enhancing the admin dashboard. Initially tasked with a landing page, the immediate priority shifted to real UltraMSG integration, which involved replacing mocked APIs, configuring webhooks, and establishing a robust communication flow. Subsequent work addressed critical issues like AI message loops, duplicate lead creation, and ensuring accurate data capture for quotes. Significant feature additions included AI prompt customization, automatic quote generation with PDF output, and admin tools for lead management and dashboard KPIs. The engineer meticulously debugged UI syntax, database inconsistencies (duplicate brokers/insurers, missing insurance product data), and AI conversational context. The process involved frequent testing, data cleanup, and code adjustments across both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI). The work was interrupted while implementing WhatsApp notifications to brokers upon lead assignment, with a user query regarding an authorization code for transaction deletion.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the lead assignment process to include WhatsApp notifications to brokers. Specifically, the task was to:
1.  **Modify  function in **: To send a WhatsApp message to the assigned broker whenever a new lead is automatically assigned.
2.  **Create a  function**: This new utility function handles the actual sending of the WhatsApp message to the broker.
3.  **Integrate notification into manual assignment**: Ensure that the notification is also sent when a lead is manually assigned via the admin dashboard (specifically, within the  endpoint).

The engineer has successfully identified and modified the  function to include the notification. The  function has been created. The next step was to integrate this notification into the manual assignment endpoint.

The last interaction was a user asking: cual es el codigo de autorizacion para eliminar transacciones (What is the authorization code to delete transactions). This indicates a new, unrelated query interrupting the current task.
